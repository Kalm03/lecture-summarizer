### Project Introduction and Purpose

This project is called Lecture Summarizer. The purpose of this project was to utilize machine learning to summarize lecture videos.



### Background 

This project was assigned to us in CPEN 291: Computer Engineering Design Studio 1. We were tasked to collaborate to create a meaningful program that utilizes machine learning tools we had learned in class. Our group decided upon this topic by our common interest in wanting a tool that would help us summarize online lectures as they became more popular.
